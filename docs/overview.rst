Overview

Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of Phantom data.

Plonk aims to provide an alternative to PhantomAnalysis and Splash. PhantomAnalysis, which is distributed with Phantom itself, and Splash are both written in Fortran, and thus, as compiled binary programs, are somewhat less flexible and scriptable than an interpreted Python program.

Plonk contains Fortran interpolation subroutines from Splash as part of the visualization module.
