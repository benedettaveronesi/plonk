Plonk overview
==============

Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of Phantom data. It also contains Fortran code from Splash as part of the visualization module.

Plonk aims to provide an alternative to PhantomAnalysis and Splash. PhantomAnalysis, which is distributed with Phantom itself, and Splash are both written in Fortran, and thus, as compiled binary programs, are somewhat less flexible and scriptable than an interpreted Python program.
