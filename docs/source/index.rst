.. warning::
    Plonk is under development. The API may change. It may contain bugs.
    However, please use Plonk and provide feedback by raising a `GitHub issue
    <https://github.com/dmentipl/plonk/issues/new/choose>`_.

Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics data with a focus on astrophysical fluid dynamics, as opposed to
cosmology.

With Plonk we aim to provide a Python alternative to tools such as the analysis
tools bundled with Phantom, and to the visualization tool Splash.

Other Packages
--------------

Here are some other, mature, Python analysis and visualization packages for
smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and other scientific, data:

* `pynbody <http://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/>`_ --- "an analysis package for
  astrophysical N-body and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulations".
* `Py-SPHViewer <http://alejandrobll.github.io/py-sphviewer/>`_ --- "a parallel
  Python package to visualise and explore N-body + Hydrodynamics simulations
  using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme".
* `yt <https://yt-project.org/>`_ project --- "yt is an open-source,
  permissively-licensed Python package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric
  data".

In addition, `SPLASH <https://github.com/danieljprice/splash>`_ is a mature,
Unix command line, "free and open source visualisation tool for Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations", written in Fortran.
