--------
Overview
--------

Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics data with a focus on astrophysical fluid dynamics, as opposed to
cosmology.

With Plonk we aim to provide a Python alternative to tools such as the analysis
tools bundled with Phantom, and to the visualization tool Splash.
