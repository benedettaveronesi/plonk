--------
Overview
--------

Plonk is a Python tool for analysis and visualization of smoothed particle
hydrodynamics data with a focus on astrophysical fluid dynamics, as opposed to
cosmology. For example, simulations of accretion discs, or star formation.

Plonk aims to provide an alternative to tools such as the Phantom analysis tools
and Splash. A problem with both of those tools is that they are compiled, and as
such they are less flexible and scriptable than interpreted Python code.
