Plonk examples
==============

There are two short example scripts to demonstrate Plonk. `analyze_disc.py` shows an example analysis of a accretion disc simulation. `visualize_disc.py` shows an example visualisation of a accretion disc.

There is also a Jupyter notebook, saved in this repository as the markdown file `tutorial.md`. To convert it to a Jupyter notebook that can then be run, do:

```
make notebook
```

This should produce a file `tutorial.ipynb` that you can run in Jupyter Lab.

*Note: this requires both Jupyter and Jupytext to be installed. They both can be installed via Conda. See https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext for details on Jupytext.*
