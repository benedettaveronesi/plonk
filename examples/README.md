Plonk examples
==============

There are two short example scripts to demonstrate Plonk. One shows and example analysis, and the other shows visualisation.

There is also a Jupyter notebook, saved in this repository as a markdown file. To convert to a notebook:

```
make notebook
```

This should produce a file `tutorial.ipynb` that you can run in Jupyter Lab.
